# springboot-microservices-architecture-online-shop

In this project, I teach you how to implement a full fletched online store in microservices architecture. Technologies used in this series include but not limited to java,springboot,edureka cloud server,cloud gateway,actuator,swagger,e.t.c I have tried to add a full description of step by step processes that we will be getting through adn I will be dropping each stage as a video on my youtube channel. Feel free to go, subscribe, like and share your thoughts. I will try to mae each video not mnore than 5 minutes so that tyou can easily follow. As soon as the video is ready, I wil provide the link here.

**TO DOs**


 **Introduction   :**
 - [ ] why micro-services architecture
 - [ ] what you are going to learn
 - [ ] development ehnvironment setup
 - [ ] video link to introductory video


 **Eureka Cloud Service  :**
 - [ ] creating the service
 - [ ] initiating service discovery


 **Product Service  :**
 - [ ] created the service
 - [ ] implementing swagger for documentation (i personally find this as a better alternative to postman on my machines which is slightly slower)
 - [ ] writing end points
 - [ ] hot code swapping (dev tools)
 - [ ] intergrating database (mysql)
 - [ ] data validation (REST API)

 - [ ] centralised logging (all endpoints)
 - [ ] centralised logging (masking data on request)
 - [ ] centralised logging (filtering requests)
 - [ ] centralised logging (externalising all logs to a file)
 - [ ] implementing health monitoring using actuator
 - [ ] intergrating resilience-4j as circuit breaker
 - [ ] implementing security on endpoints
 - [ ] advanced swagger documentation
 - [ ] unit testing
 - [ ] intergrated testing
 - [ ] optionals (intergrating code coverage using Jococvob and veryfying using mutation testing , code analysiss using sornarqube)
