# springboot-microservices-architecture-online-shop

In this project, I teach you how to implement a full fletched online store in microservices architecture. Technologies used in this series include but not limited to java,springboot,edureka cloud server,cloud gateway,actuator,swagger,e.t.c I have tried to add a full description of step by step processes that we will be getting through adn I will be dropping each stage as a video on my youtube channel. Feel free to go, subscribe, like and share your thoughts. I will try to mae each video not mnore than 5 minutes so that tyou can easily follow. As soon as the video is ready, I wil provide the links here on eaach stage.
I will provide a whatsapp group for those who are interesed in learning microservices architecture back-end as well as offer live coding sessions.

**Once the session begins, the repository will be made private to allow only subscribed members to access**

**TO DOs**


 **Introduction   :**
 - [ ] why micro-services architecture
 - [ ] what you are going to learn

 - [ ] implementing health monitoring using actuator
 - [ ] intergrating resilience-4j as circuit breaker
 - [ ] implementing security on endpoints
 - [ ] advanced swagger documentation
 - [ ] unit testing
 - [ ] intergrated testing
 - [ ] optionals (intergrating code coverage using Jococvob and veryfying using mutation testing , code analysiss using sornarqube)


**Springboot Admin Server  :**
 - [ ] creating Admin and client server
 - [ ] registering multiple instances
 - [ ] changing log levels
 - [ ] data persistance and clustering (optional - Hazelcast)
 - [ ] makling the interface lot beautiful



**Order Service  :**
 - [ ] creating the service
 - [ ] writing end points

**Mock a Paymnet service  :**
 - [ ] use WIREMOCK
 
 
**Distributed Tracing  :**
